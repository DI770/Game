# Introduction

In this project, there is three pages.
The first page introduces the user to the rules game of Rock-Paper-Scissor-Lizard-Spock. 
Page two is where the game can be played.
On page three, the user can click thru several quotes. Or let them scroll by, one at a time. 
The quotes are set to refresh in a 30 second interval.


## Problems 

I had a hard time learning JavaScript. 
I learned the different things that you use in the coding. The coding of let, var, const, array and many more things. 
But when I started to put down functions in java files, the knowledge I thought I had learned, flowed away from me. Like I never learned them.
These two JavaScript files that is written here. What takes a good coder some hours, took me weeks.
I needed to find information in several places and cross reference with what I knew, just to remember what I was seeing and what the code did, before I could code.
And make it functional.
Put me infront of a done JavaScript and I could read it and tell you what its functions does. 
But put me infront of a blank page and tell me to build a new code and I would struggle.

#### Extra Word

I am not proud of this project. Had I had a couple more weeks, maybe I could have made a better job. 
But that is a big maybe. 
My Rock-Paper-Scissor-Lizard-Spock is more or less a rip off from the Rock-Paper-Scissor video that is provided here.
The quote machine that I have, is just me extending an existing work. The original work can be found in the Freecode camp link.
As I said earlier, I can read and understand their code. I know what they do and how they work.
If I were to make a new JavaScript, I would struggle to make it. But if I could cross reference with other code I have seen before. 
Then hopefully, I could make my own code.
But if wishes were horses, beggars would ride.
